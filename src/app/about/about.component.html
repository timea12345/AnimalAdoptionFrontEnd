<p style="padding: 150px;"> An animal shelter or pound is a place that stray, lost, abandoned or surrendered animals, mostly dogs and cats and sometimes sick or wounded wildlife, are kept and rehabilitated. While no-kill shelters exist, it is sometimes policy to euthanize animals that are not claimed quickly enough by a previous or new owner. In Europe, of the 30 countries included in a survey, all but five (Austria[1], Czech Republic,[2] Germany, Greece and Italy) permitted the killing of healthy stray dogs.[3] Critics believe the new term "animal shelter" is generally a euphemism for the older term "pound".

  The word "pound" has its origins in the animal pounds of agricultural communities, where stray livestock would be penned or impounded until they were claimed by their owners.</p>
